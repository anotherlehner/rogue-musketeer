# h-rl

A dark fantasy roguelike for the web in the spirit of the classic game Heretic.

## Building

```
npm run build
```

Put the resulting dist wherever that's web accessible. This game does not include any sounds, however, it's really great with sounds... If you have a copy of the Heretic shareware and unpack the sounds and put them in the `sounds` folder as mp3s it'll be a lot more fun.
